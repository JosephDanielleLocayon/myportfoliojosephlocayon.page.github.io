          <h2>Joseph Danielle Locayon from BSIS-2B</h2>
          <p>I'm Joseph Locayon, a typical guy who likes to keep things simple. While I'm comfortable around people I know, I can feel a bit shy in new situations. I prefer a laid-back style and staying home rather than going out. I take pride in being reliable and easy to get along with, always open to making new friends. 

My family isn't rich, but we always have more than enough food, which is probably why I've put on some weight. We live a simple life, and I want to finish my education to repay my parents for all they've done for me. I'm a 21-year-old second-year student at Northwest Samar State University (NWSSU). I was born on July 27, 2002.</p>

            <p>And lastly, I have been at NWSSU since 2023. I took the entrance exam and passed, but it was for a non-board program, so I enrolled in BSIS (BS Information System). I am now in my second year of college.</p>
